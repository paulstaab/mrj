mrj - Muller's Ratchet in Java
==============================

This is a Java simulation program I wrote for my 
[Diploma Thesis](https://github.com/paulstaab/diplomarbeit) in 2011. 
It (forward) simulates a population of haploids undergoing 
[Muller's Ratchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muller%27s_ratchet) 
with optinonal compensatory mutations as decribed in the thesis.

Installation
------------
Build a jar from this folder. Should be easy (as far as I remember...).


Usage
-----
java -jar mrj.jar --help should give some help on running the program.
